                        <ul className="mb-30">
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Account Information:</strong> You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to keep your account information updated. Account registration may require providing your name, contact information, organization (if applicable), and payment details for subscription services.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>User Credentials:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials (username and password). You must not share your login details or allow any unauthorized person to access your account. If you are an organization, each individual user should have their own account credentials; sharing accounts among multiple users is not permitted.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Responsibility for Activities:</strong> You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or a security breach, you must promptly notify us. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account, and you may be held liable for losses incurred by the Company or others due to such unauthorized use.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Account Security:</strong> We implement industry-standard security measures to protect accounts, but you must also use a strong password and follow good security practices. Any activity conducted through your account will be deemed to be authorized by you; please safeguard your credentials accordingly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-30">
                          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that we suspect are being used in violation of these Terms or any applicable law (see Termination below).
                        </p>

                        <h3 className="mb-20">3. Subscription Plans, Fees, and Payments</h3>
                        <p className="mb-20">
                          Ligit offers both subscription-based services and one-time purchase options (for example, purchasing a one-time document analysis or daily access pass). By selecting a paid plan or service, you agree to the following payment terms:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="mb-30">
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Fees:</strong> You agree to pay all applicable fees for the subscription plan or one-time services you select, as displayed at the time of purchase. Pricing and available plans are described on the Ligit platform. We may offer monthly or annual subscriptions, enterprise plans for law firms, and one-off usage options. All fees are charged in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) or as otherwise indicated, and are inclusive of applicable taxes unless stated.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Billing & Payment:</strong> For subscriptions, fees will be billed in advance on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually) to the payment method you provide. You authorize us to charge your chosen payment method on the schedule of your subscription. One-time purchases (such as a single document processing) will be charged at the point of purchase. If a payment fails or is not made on time, we may suspend or restrict your account until payment is received. You are responsible for providing a valid payment method and resolving any payment issues.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Free Trials:</strong> If we offer a free trial for any service, such trial is available one-time to new users only at our discretion. We reserve the right to modify or end a free trial at any time. After the trial period, you will need to subscribe or pay to continue using the services. During the trial, these Terms still fully apply.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Changes in Fees:</strong> Our fees are subject to change. Any fee changes for subscriptions will be communicated to you with reasonable notice via email or via the platform. Changes will apply at the start of the next billing cycle. If you do not agree with a fee change, you may cancel your subscription before the new fees take effect (see Cancellation below). Continuing to use the service after the price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Refunds:</strong> All purchases are final and non-refundable by default, except as described in our Refund Policy or as required by applicable law. We may consider refund requests for subscription plans if made within a specified number of days from purchase (per the Refund Policy), but we are not obligated to provide refunds for partial use or remaining period of a subscription. For example, if our Refund Policy allows cancellation within 5 days of a monthly subscription purchase, you may be eligible for a refund by contacting us within that window; otherwise, the subscription will run until the end of the paid term and simply not renew thereafter. No pro-rated refunds will be given for unused portions of a subscription term.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>One-Time Purchase Usage:</strong> One-time service purchases (such as a daily pass or single document analysis) are typically not eligible for refund once the service has been used. Please review the details of each service before purchase.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Taxes:</strong> If any taxes (e.g., GST) are applicable on the services, you are responsible for paying such taxes. We will add taxes to the charges as required by law.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-30">
                          By purchasing a subscription or service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the specific pricing, billing frequency, and refund terms presented at the point of purchase.

                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Violate Laws or Rights:</strong> Use the platform for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international laws. This includes (but is not limited to) not using Ligit to engage in fraud, money laundering, or to infringe upon intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of others. You must not upload or input any content that you do not have the right to use or that is defamatory, obscene, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable or illegal.</li>

For example, you should not generate bulk outputs via Ligit and then charge third parties for those outputs as a standalone product. The services and outputs are meant for your professional use within your own legal matters or within your firm's practice, not for creating a competing repository or product out of Ligit's results.</li>
                          <li className="mb-10"><strong>Interference and Other Violations:</strong> Engage in any other conduct that, in our determination, restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the service, or which may harm the Company or other users, or expose them to liability.

                          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Ligit is intended for users in India, and we operate in compliance with Indian laws and regulations.

                          If a dispute cannot be resolved amicably within 30 days from the time informal resolution is pursued, the dispute shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator appointed by the Company. The seat and venue of arbitration shall be Gurugram, Haryana, India (or New Delhi, if Gurugram is not available), and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. Each party shall bear its own costs for the arbitration, and share equally the fees of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator's award provides otherwise. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                          Subject to the above arbitration clause, any dispute or claim that is not subject to arbitration will be adjudicated exclusively in the courts of Gurugram, Haryana, India. Both you and the Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Gurugram, Haryana for the purpose of litigating such claims or to seek interim/interlocutory relief or enforcement of the arbitration award, if necessary. You agree that Gurugram, Haryana is a convenient forum and you waive any objection to the jurisdiction or venue of those courts.
