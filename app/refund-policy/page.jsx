                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-20"><strong>Note:</strong></p>

                        <h4 className="mb-10">b. One-Time Purchases (Pay-per-use Services)</h4>
                        <p className="mb-20">If you purchase a one-time service (such as document drafting, legal chronology generation, or translation), you may be eligible for a refund only if:</p>
                        <ul className="mb-30">
                          <li className="mb-10">You have not initiated the service (i.e., not uploaded a document or started a task); and</li>
                          <li className="mb-10">The refund request is made within 48 hours of purchase.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-30">
                          Refunds will not be granted for one-time services that have already been consumed or generated, unless there was a demonstrable technical error or system failure that prevented delivery of the promised output.

                          <li className="mb-10">Dissatisfaction due to subjective expectations not being met (e.g., output quality not matching personal preferences).</li>
                          <li className="mb-10">Inaccuracies or omissions in AI-generated results (users are expected to review all outputs).</li>
                          <li className="mb-10">Failure to cancel a subscription before renewal.</li>
